## Basic Vector Operations with Checkmarks and Crosses

This project contains Python code for performing basic vector operations using NumPy. The user can input the elements of two vectors from the keyboard. The script also provides the results of various vector operations.

## Operations Included

1. Vector addition
2. Vector subtraction
3. Dot product
4. Cross product (only for 3-dimensional vectors)
5. Magnitude of a vector

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    \"""
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Victors.git
    \"""

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    \"""
    cd Victors
    \"""

3. Install the dependencies:
    \"""
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \"""

4. Run the Python script:
    \"""
    python vector_operations.py
    \"""

5. Follow the prompts to input the elements of the vectors. The script will then display the results of various vector operations.

## Example

After running the script, you will be prompted to enter the elements of two vectors. The script will then display the results of various vector operations.

### Sample Input
\"""
Enter the first vector: 1 2 3
Enter the second vector: 4 5 6
\"""

### Sample Output
\"""
Vector 1: [1. 2. 3.]
Vector 2: [4. 5. 6.]

Vector addition (v1 + v2): [5. 7. 9.]
Vector subtraction (v1 - v2): [-3. -3. -3.]
Dot product (v1 . v2): 32.0
Cross product (v1 x v2): [-3.  6. -3.]
Magnitude of vector 1 (|v1|): 3.7416573867739413
Magnitude of vector 2 (|v2|): 8.774964387392123
